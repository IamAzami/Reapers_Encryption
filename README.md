This was my first coding project that i made to learn Python after learning about the language. This Python code implements a basic text encryption and decryption system, using custom mappings for characters and symbols. The encryption function substitutes each character in the input with a designated symbol or number based on a predefined dictionary, creating an encoded message. The decryption function reverses this process, translating each symbol back to its original character. Special symbols (like sym1, sym2) are also added to give a decorative border around the final output.

The display function serves as a main menu, allowing users to choose between encrypting, decrypting, or exiting the program. The code uses extensive conditional checks to map individual characters, though it could be simplified by directly referencing keys in the dictionaries, improving both readability and efficiency.
